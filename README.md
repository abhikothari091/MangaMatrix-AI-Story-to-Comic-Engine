# MangaMatrix: AI Story-to-Comic Engine

MangaMatrix is an AI-powered comic generation pipeline that transforms short story prompts into manga-style comic panels. It leverages large language models and image generation APIs to build a fully automated storytelling and illustration engine.

## Features

- **Story Generation** ‚Äì Uses a fine-tuned LLaMA model to convert user prompts into 5-panel story arcs.
- **Panel Elaboration** ‚Äì Employs a Mistral-based model to break each panel into 3‚Äì4 subpanels with detailed scene descriptions.
- **Visual Generation** ‚Äì Uses OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E 3 to turn each subpanel into high-quality manga-style images.
- **PDF Compilation** ‚Äì Automatically compiles all generated images into a downloadable manga PDF.
- **Interactive UI** ‚Äì Clean, themed frontend with light/dark mode and smooth navigation between pages.

### Key Components

- `UI/app.py`: Main entry point to run the web app with prompt input and response rendering.
- `Final_Generation_Pipeline.ipynb`: Ties together prompt, story generation, panel elaboration, image creation, and PDF compilation.
- `Anime_data_llama_finetune.ipynb`: Trains LLaMA on your custom anime-style data for improved panel storytelling.
- `static/generated/`: Location where your final manga-style PDF is saved for download.
